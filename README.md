### Docker for API server's database

If you want to work with the API server, you need to start the database first. We use docker-compose to run the database on locally. You can start the database by running the following command.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### .env file

For some packages can't work without an `env` file. You can find the required env file in each package's `.env.test`. You can copy and rename it to `.env` and fill in the required env variables.
