## Basic Usage

### 1. Add container

After installing the widget, Add the following code as a container for the widget:

<Tabs groupId="frameworks">
<TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">

```html
<drop-feedback project-id="your_project_id" />
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="react" label="React">

```tsx
import { DropFeedback } from "@dropfeedback/react";

<DropFeedback projectId="your_project_id" />;
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

We recommend adding the container to the root of your application.

### 2. Add trigger

To open the widget, you need to add a trigger. Add the `data-feedback-button` attribute to any element.

```html
<button data-feedback-button>Feedback</button>
```

If you want to identify the user, you can add the `data-report-identifier` attribute to the trigger element and pass in the currently authenticated user's email or id.

```html
<button data-feedback-button data-report-identifier="...">Feedback</button>
```

Refer to the [User Identification](/user-identification) cheatsheet for more information.

## Customize Your Widget

The widget is fully customizable. You can change the colors, position, and more. Check out the [Widget Customization](/widget-customization) cheatsheet for more information.

## Feedback Analysis

Once feedback starts coming in, you can analyze it on the [dashboard](https://dropfeedback.com/dashboard). You can also receive feedback via email.
