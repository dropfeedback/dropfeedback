# Feedbacky

Let’s imagine that you’ve decided to build a start-up and that you have a great idea, which is a feedback system that enables customers to give feedback on e-commerce websites. You are both the founder and technical chief of your startup.

So, let’s start building your startup!

**Here are the Acceptance Criteria:**

- You don’t have access to your clients’ code base
- Your client-side code should be easily integrable
- You should show your client’s feedback in a simple HTML table or on a Google Sheet File
- Expected code coverage is 100%
- You can use any tech stack which you feel comfortable with

Your first customer is Trendyol, and you can reach Trendyol’s expectations on the images below:

**Nice to have topics that could help your possible client to buy your service:**

- An online demo
- Well documented product
- Dealing with security concerns
- Bug free and 100% unit test coverage
- Well performanced client side library
- Responsive Design
- Clean code and readable folder structure

**PS:** Please include **"case is done"** in your last commit.
