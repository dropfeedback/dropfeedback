# Project Structure

This Turborepo includes the following packages and apps:

#### Packages

- [api](./packages/feedbacky): an [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) server that provides an API for the client
- [widget](./packages/widget): a [Svelte](https://kit.svelte.dev/) app that provides a widget to be embedded in the client's website.

#### Apps

- [dashboard](./apps/dashboard/): a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app that provides a dashboard for the client to manage their project and feedbacks.

# Development

This project uses [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/) to manage the monorepo.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) tested on v18.10.0 (LTS) but should work on any version >= 16.14.0.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) tested on v20.10.24.

> ðŸš¨ If you want to run tests on your local machine, you may need to install following dependencies to run required [bash scripts](./packages/api/scripts/) before tests.
>
> ```
> brew install coreutils && alias timeout=gtimeout
> chmod +x scripts/*
> ```

## Running the project

First we need to set environment variables. You can do this by creating a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. You can use the `.env.test` file as a template.

> ðŸš¨ following `.env` files are required to run the project:

- [api/.env](./packages/api/.env)

To work with [api](./packages/api) and [dashboard](./apps/dashboard) locally, you need setup a local database. You can do this by running following commands:

```bash
docker compose up -d
npm run db:generate
npm run db:push
npm run db:seed
npm run build
npm run dev
```

If you already setup the database, you can run the project with following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` command will run all the packages and apps in parallel. If you want to run a specific package or app, you can
use [Turborepo filters](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/monorepos/filtering#multiple-filters) to do so. For example, if you want to run only `api` and `dashboard` packages, you can run following command:

```bash
npm run dev -- --filter=@feedbacky/api --filter=@feedbacky/dashboard
```

By default following ports are used:

- [api](./packages/api): http://localhost:8080
- [dashboard](./apps/dashboard): http://localhost:3000
- [widget](./packages/widget): http://localhost:5173

## Running tests

To run tests, you can use following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

Running this command will automatically create a new database, generate Prisma (and other necessary configurations) for testing, and execute all the tests in parallel.

> brew install coreutils && alias timeout=gtimeout
> chmod +x scripts/*
> ```

# Feedbacky

Letâ€™s imagine that youâ€™ve decided to build a start-up and that you have a great idea, which is a feedback system that enables customers to give feedback on e-commerce websites. You are both the founder and technical chief of your startup.

So, letâ€™s start building your startup!

**Here are the Acceptance Criteria:**

- You donâ€™t have access to your clientsâ€™ code base
- Your client-side code should be easily integrable
- You should show your clientâ€™s feedback in a simple HTML table or on a Google Sheet File
- Expected code coverage is 100%
- You can use any tech stack which you feel comfortable with

Your first customer is Trendyol, and you can reach Trendyolâ€™s expectations on the images below:

<img src="./assets/feedbacky2.png" width="600" height="400">

**Nice to have topics that could help your possible client to buy your service:**

- An online demo
- Well documented product
- Dealing with security concerns
- Bug free and 100% unit test coverage
- Well performanced client side library
- Responsive Design
- Clean code and readable folder structure

**PS:** Please include **"case is done"** in your last commit.
